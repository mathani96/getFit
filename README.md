Our questions:

1. Is our  navigation done correctly?

2. Are the components used correctly? what should we change? 
 
    2.1. The timer currently is directly implemented in the WorkoutPage, should we leave it as is or make it its own component?
    2.2. For the rest of the content that will come(Progress bar and demonstration) should we implement directly in the page or create components?

3. We have not yet come to the part we we save how namy worjouts have been done, but it would be nice if you could remind us how this can be done.

4. is the usage of the object file for the paths ok?

5. Some parts are only place holder right now(contents in progress page, and progress bar in WorkoutPage).



For us: ap icon in app.json // app icon path comes here
